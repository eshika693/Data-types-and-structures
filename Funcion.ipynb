Unlike regular functions created with def, a lambda function can have only one expression and returns its result automatically. The basic syntax is lambda arguments: expression. Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations where defining a full function using def would be unnecessary. They are commonly used in functional programming with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted() to define quick, inline operations. For example, sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1]) sorts a list based on the second element of each tuple. Lambda functions improve code conciseness but should be used sparingly, as complex expressions can reduce readability. They are best suited for short-lived, one-time-use functions, such as when passing a function as an argument in higher-order functions or when defining simple mathematical computations inline."

Its syntax is map(function, iterable), where the function is applied to each element of the iterable. The result is a map object, which can be converted into a list or another collection if needed. map() is particularly useful for performing operations on large datasets efficiently, as it eliminates the need for explicit loops. For example, map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4]) returns [1, 4, 9, 16] by squaring each number in the list. It is commonly used in functional programming to transform data concisely while improving readability and performance. However, in modern Python, list comprehensions are often preferred for better readability unless working with large datasets where map() offers memory efficiency by processing items lazily."

For example, map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]) returns [2, 4, 6]. filter(), on the other hand, is used for filtering elements based on a condition, returning only the elements that satisfy the given function. For example, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4]) returns [2, 4], keeping only even numbers. reduce(), from the functools module, applies a function cumulatively to reduce an iterable to a single value. For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 2, 3, 4]) returns 24 by multiplying all numbers together. While map() and filter() return iterables, reduce() returns a single computed result. map() is best for transformations, filter() for selection, and reduce() for cumulative computations, making them powerful tools in functional programming.
